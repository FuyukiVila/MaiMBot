# Active Context

This file is used as a short-term memory or "work journal" for the currently active, complex subtask.

- **NexusCore (Orchestrator):** Before assigning a new complex subtask, NexusCore may clear or archive the contents of this file.
- **Subtask Mode (e.g., Code, Debug):** When instructed, the assigned mode will meticulously log its entire work process hereâ€”including analysis, steps, and findings.
- **NexusCore (Post-Subtask):** After the subtask is complete, NexusCore will review this log to understand the work performed and integrate key insights into the long-term Memory Bank files (e.g., `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`).
